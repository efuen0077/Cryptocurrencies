# Cryptocurrencies

## Challenge

### Data Preprocessing

- Remove all cryptocurrencies that aren’t trading.
- Remove all cryptocurrencies that don’t have an algorithm defined.
- Remove the IsTrading column.
- Remove all cryptocurrencies with at least one null value.
- Remove all cryptocurrencies without coins mined.
- Store the names of all cryptocurrencies on a DataFramed named coins_name, and use the crypto_df.index as the index     for this new DataFrame.
- Remove the CoinName column.
- Create dummies variables for all of the text features, and store the resulting data on a DataFrame named X.
- Use the StandardScaler from sklearn (Links to an external site.) to standardize all of the data from the X DataFrame. 

### Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
- Use the PCA algorithm from sklearn (Links to an external site.) to reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame down to three principal components.
- create a DataFrame named “pcs_df” that includes the following columns: PC 1, PC 2, and PC 3.
- Use the crypto_df.index as the index for this new DataFrame.

### Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
- Create an elbow curve to find the best value for K, and use the pcs_df DataFrame.
- Once you define the best value for K, run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data. Use the pcs_df to run the K-means algorithm.
- Create a new DataFrame named “clustered_df,” that includes the following columns: Algorithm, ProofType,   TotalCoinsMined, TotalCoinSupply, PC 1, PC 2, PC 3, CoinName, and Class.

### Visualizing Results
- Create a 3D scatter plot using Plotly Express to plot the clusters using the clustered_df DataFrame. You should include the following parameters on the plot: hover_name="CoinName" and hover_data=["Algorithm"] to show this additional info on each data point.
- Use hvplot.table to create a data table with all the current tradable cryptocurrencies. The table should have the following columns: CoinName, Algorithm, ProofType, TotalCoinSupply, TotalCoinsMined, and Class.
- Create a scatter plot using hvplot.scatter to present the clustered data about cryptocurrencies having x="TotalCoinsMined" and y="TotalCoinSupply" to contrast the number of available coins versus the total number of mined coins. Use the hover_cols=["CoinName"] parameter to include the cryptocurrency name on each data point.
